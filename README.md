### What I learned

I followed along with the tutorial on React documentation to create this project locally and understand React better. I already knew the syntax, useState hook, rendering methods, and the principle of immutability in React, but I learned when and how state should be lifted and how useState can be used to save history and render a point that history. I already feel more comfortable using React and I plan to finish reading the documentation along with doing all the exercises to gain a deeper understanding of React.

### Useful resources

- [React docs](https://react.dev/) - Documentation is the best place to learn a library or framework.
